Task Predecessor Testing Documentation
Overview
This document provides comprehensive test scenarios for the Task Predecessor functionality. The predecessor system allows tasks to be linked with dependency relationships, automatically calculating dates based on the predecessor's timeline.
System Constraints
* One Predecessor per Task: Each task can have only one predecessor
* Multiple Successors: A task can be a predecessor to multiple tasks
* No Circular Dependencies: System prevents dependency loops
* Duration Preservation: Task duration is maintained when dates are recalculated
* Four Link Types: SS (Start-to-Start), SF (Start-to-Finish), FF (Finish-to-Finish), FS (Finish-to-Start)
* Lag Support: Positive or negative lag in days
Predecessor Schema
predecessor: {
  taskId: ObjectId,     // Reference to predecessor task (null if none)
  type: String,         // "SS" | "SF" | "FF" | "FS" (default: "FS")
  lag: Number          // Days offset (default: 0)
}

9. Common Issues & Debugging
Issue: Dates Not Recalculating
Check:
* Predecessor task exists in database
* Predecessor has valid startDate and dueDate
* Link type is valid (SS, SF, FF, FS)
* Lag is a number
Issue: Duration Not Preserved
Check:
* Original task has both startDate and dueDate
* Duration calculation: moment(dueDate).diff(moment(startDate), 'days') + 1
* No rounding errors in date calculations
Issue: Cascade Not Working
Check:
* Task has successors (other tasks reference it as predecessor)
* updateSuccessorDates function is called
* Recursive updates are working
* No errors in successor chain
Issue: Circular Dependency Not Detected
Check:
* checkCircularDependency function is called
* BFS traversal is working correctly
* Visited set is being tracked
* All predecessor chains are checked
